# Neural-Network-Construction
Given an outline of how to construct a neural netwrok from scratch.
Completed the code, added elements such as regularization, storing training history to see/plot accuracy as epochs pass.

Used the network to run on two particulars, such as digit recogniziton, and on some shapes.
